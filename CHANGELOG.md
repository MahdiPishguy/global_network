## [0.1.4] - Release.

- global_network is a package that can be used in any app ranging from small learning apps to large & complex apps in production.
- I observed that when there are multiple screens in an app it is very time consuming to implement network check on individual screen.
- With this package this problem will become much simpler. No need to use network check at individual screen just use this package .

- initially app is in offline mode issue fixed

## [0.1.3]

## features added

- Will be able to display the Bottlesheet, Alert dialog etc.
- Customisable "warning screen" as per your requirements.
